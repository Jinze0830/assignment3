1. Running time will be changed when I used different cores and executors. The more clusters was used the shower KMeans runtime will be.

2. I test MLlib K-means. When I use 10 cluster and implenment on my local mechine it will take 2-3 mins. However, When I use my own program it will take more than 15 mins.

3. Each data poit is assigned to a single prototype. As long as the cheap and expensive distance metrics are suffciently similar that the nearest prototype(as calculated with the cheap distance metric).

4. Compute the cos distance instead of Euclidean distance will make the program more efficent
